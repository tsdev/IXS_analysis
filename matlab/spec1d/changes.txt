This file is inteded to write down local changes to be debugged and implemented.

%%%%% HMR July 2001

On can now specify e.g. [51 161] in loads - the routine will add leading zeros.

%%%%% HMR April 2001

17/4-2001: Change fits.m so that it removes points with zero error rather than points with zero y.
18/4-2001: Changed smooth to take vectors
18/4-2001: Changed times to take vectors

%%%%% ESRF id20 experiment April 2001

7/4-2001 HMR: specbatch.m before a file with zeroes in the monitor got
monitor of 1 for all data points. Now only for those with zero
monitor.

7/4-2001 HMR: cut.m now does vectors of spectra

7/4-2001 HMR: loads now sorts the data pooints.

10/4-2001 HMR: If column headertoo short, specbatch adds DegK
(temperature) after the L column.

%%%%% Jan 2001

List of changes by DFM

 1. fits.m : line 35, now uses one background point, works with spec1d arrays
 2. plot.m: turn off tex interpreter for labels
 3. extract.m: modified to work with spec1d arrays
 4. peakt.m: modified to work with spec1d arrays
 5. peakm.m: modified to work with spec1d arrays

%%%%% Nov 2000

List of changes by HMR

List of changes to spec1D files.
20/11-2000 HMR, NBC, BHL, Anyone else ?

spec1d.m:  spec1d(a,b,c) -> s.x=, s.y=b, s.e=c

gfields.m: renamed to getfield.m (consistent with struct/getfield)
sfields.m: renamed to setfield.m (Could be simplified by using the built in).

combine.m: Before a simple mean was perfomed. 
This is wrong for counts taken with different monitor counts, 
which is one of the most used applications of this function.
One can now specify method='mean', 'counts' or 'weight'.
'counts' is default.

cut.m: Changed help text slightly.

mapplot.m: Creates a 2D map from an array of spectra.

minus.m: Changed, to minus(s1,s2)=plus(s1,-1*s2)

plus.m: If spectra do not have same length, s2 is interpolated to 
the x-values of s1.

mtimes.m: Calls times.m so that 2*s2 works aswell as 2.*s2

mrdivide.m: Calls rdivide.m so that 1/s and s/2 works aswell as 1./s and s./2

smooth.m: Convolutes data with a Gaussian - as if choosing worse 
resolution. For aiding data-asessment - not for manipulation!

What is the point in having transform.m
why not call directly dydx(s) and normalise(s,maxvalue)

vertcat.m: Fewer lines version - same functionality.

interpolate.m: Interpolates a spectrum to new x-values.
Is called by plus.m, times.m and rdivide.m


THINGS STILL TO DO:
Having both combine and rebin is a bit overlapping.
Rebin should be reviewed concerning how averaging is done.
