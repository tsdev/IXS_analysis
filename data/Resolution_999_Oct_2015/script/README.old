resolution-filename:
1) filename-extension ".dat" corresponds to:
   resolution profile normalized to area=1
   mostly profiles are fitted and cleaned from background
   NOT when profile is asymetric
   
2) filename-extension ".exp" corresponds to:
   resolution profile not normalized, includes background, not fitted
   just the " original" data after extracting from SPECfile and normdata!

All files aXresYY.* in this directory are the latest resolution-profiles
available for ID28. They are those to be used for fitting/convolutions
of experimental data.
